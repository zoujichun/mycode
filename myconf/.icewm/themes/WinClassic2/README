=== IceWM WinClassic Theme ===

This theme is based on a couple of screenshots made with Windows XP.
Homepage: http://themes.freshmeat.net/projects/winclassic/

Requirements:
  * IceWM must be compiled with --enable-gradients
  * The Tahoma and Verdana fonts. Unfortunately Tahoma is not free for
    download. If you have access to a windows computer, you can find it
    in C:\WINDOWS\Fonts. Copy the files tahoma.ttf and tahomabd.ttf to
    /usr/share/fonts/TTF. Also check http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/

Have a look inside the "icons" directory for available icons. Also check
the "misc" directory.
